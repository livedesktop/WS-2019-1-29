Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realize your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system!\r\n\r\nAvailable ingame: SlopeMania!\r\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes!

Our goal is to lead you from one “light bulb moment” to the next so that you stay energized and excited about the language.\r\n\r\nHuman Japanese is lovingly crafted by a small team that cares deeply about helping you to truly understand the language. It will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guides on the incredible journey that is learning Japanese.

View image dimensions, song bitrate, video duration and many other file properties to help you identify which files go and which stay.\r\n\r\nLarge files are also called out in their own section, so that you can remove any downloads or long-forgotten archives.  And of course, you can dig into all the files we've scanned, sorted by size. Open any folder in Explorer with a single tap.

If you've ever uploaded photos to a photo printing service, you've seen the option for wallet prints. Typically wallets will be printed as 4 images on a 4x6 or 5x7 sheet. Photo printers charge a premium for this service. Individual wallet-size images cost a fraction of their regular rate when you put them on a 4x6 image and send that to the printing service as a normal 4x6 print.\r\n\r\nGreat for scrapbooking\r\n• Make your scrapbook pages more interesting! PhotoSheet gives you control over the size and layout of images for the scrapbook layout you're working on.\r\n• Support for variable number of images: There are a host of sheet layouts offering space for anywhere from just 2 images to over 30!\r\n• Tweak the layout! You can change the size and position of individual images within the layout.\r\n• Make a sheet of 16 1\" x 1.5\" images that fit inside slide mounts.\r\n• Adjust the spacing and add rounded corners to create the vintage photo print look.\r\n• Select an image and use two fingers or your mouse wheel to zoom in and reposition images in their slots.\r\n• PhotoSheet includes a host of custom page layouts you can use directly or as inspiration for new page layouts of your own. The layouts are optimized for a variety of popular scrapbooking page sizes, and you can even change the spacing or soften the corners of the photos in your page!\r\n\r\nCollage Prints\r\n• Use your photo printer to fill those photo collage picture frames in your home. If you have too many photos to fit in the frame, this software is handy for fitting multiple pictures into a single 4x6 slot in the frame. See what the sheet will look like, rearrange the photos on the sheet, and control the rotation of individual photos.\r\n\r\nPackage Prints\r\n• Automatically rotate photos to make the best use of individual slots in the layout. A great option if you are planning on cutting out the photo after printing.\r\n• Fill a single sheet with copies of a single image, great for wallet photos or giving package prints to friends.\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n• PhotoSheet Imperial and Metric paper sizes! All of the A's and B's and P's are there for your choosing! If your favorite paper size is not in the list, don't dismay: you can enter any sheet size you like, in inches or centimeters!\r\n• PhotoSheet remembers your settings from one session to the next! If you frequently use the same layout or sheet size, you'll love this.\r\n• The film strip holds all of the photos you're working with, and page views help you build multiple pages using the same layout! Create package prints for several photos at once!\r\n• Choose a different layout and automatically fill the open spaces with unused photos, or gather images together to use fewer pages!\r\n• \"Remove\" buttons on filmstrip items, pages, and layout cells make adjustments easy when you change your mind!\r\n• Images can be repositioned and resized inside their layout cells - Select the image first, then drag the image or roll your mouse wheel to zoom. If you have a touch screen, pinch or use two fingers to move or zoom the image.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

If you’re an experienced commander, you’ll love the merciless, intense battles where the countdown where even a fraction of a second is vital to success and everything hinges on your ability to choose and arrange your turrets wisely.

The present, future, conditional and past tenses are covered, and you are taught to think about the ideas that you are trying to communicate, rather than to translate words slavishly.\r\nHe points out the similarities of the vocabulary in English and Spanish and gives you the tools to guess the words you do not know, or think you do not know.\r\nJoin two students as they learn in real time.

If the student has struggled or given an incorrect answer, s/he can use the index in the accompanying booklet to locate the area of the main course where the specific language point was being taught in depth and can return to the main course to work through the relevant section again, quickly and efficiently. It can also be used very successfully by those coming back to the course after a lapse of time, either to check how much they have retained or as a quick revision tool.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Advanced course Michel has covered ALL the structures and tenses of 'A' level and beyond.

The Kid needed to earn some cash to take his girlfriend out. So by delivering pirate video tapes to his customers and staying one step in front of the cops, he quickly became... The Videokid. \r\nRunning the gauntlet of his bogusly dangerous delivery route, The VideoKid must survive against all the odds to reach his beloved Jessica. Is today the day he'll finally reach her in time? \r\n\r\nThe VideoKid pays homage to the 1980s, and the classic videogames of that era. Harking back to a simpler time of pure gameplay, take control of The VideoKid as he hurls videos through the mailboxes, or windows, of his customers to earn cash. Dodge civilians, jump and grind cars and avoid the neighbourhood cops to stay alive. But this is no ordinary street... you may also encounter strangely-familiar characters from your past.

Added IAP to remove ads as users request, it has nothing to do with app function.\r\n\r\nSupports subtitle, background music, gesture, MKV... see Features.\r\nDLNA/UPnP: (1). Play to devices;  (2). Play files on Media Server (API not supported by phone system). \r\nSimple & Green. \r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\nCurrently it uses simple UI, you can custom panel buttons. Since it's still under development, functions can change (add/remove, FFmpeg DLL may update and change) at any time.  And currently I won't add more languages(hard to maintain).\r\nThis app is just a lite player, I do not write decoder, it uses system(sdk component) and free FFmpeg(unmodifiable, under LGPL) to decode data automatically.  I think it should support system player default formats, but I don't know how many does FFmpeg(WinRT) support. It should support most common formats, but it will not support all formats, just try, if not supported, I can do nothing to it. . The target of the app is to show my new tech & features for media playback, not to support as many formats as possible. Thanks.\r\n\r\n▶▶▶ Please make sure you have read all the instructions and options in the app, or just ask me by mail. I may not see all the reviews. Thank you very much!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5HP65","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Universal Zip","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56814.13510798886964962.6a9bca8c-251c-46f5-bb07-2e24e7604d1f.6ffea67f-9604-4dca-8699-35eafba95283","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#404040","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48201.13510798886964962.6a9bca8c-251c-46f5-bb07-2e24e7604d1f.2a76553f-3a24-4ff5-bdf2-a404b4417ab9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#404040","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8875.13510798886964962.6a9bca8c-251c-46f5-bb07-2e24e7604d1f.72187af6-1ef8-4935-a380-a679233c97bd","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60275.13510798886964962.6a9bca8c-251c-46f5-bb07-2e24e7604d1f.d3a9d7d6-f564-45de-aedf-bde7b59f604b","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56814.13510798886964962.6a9bca8c-251c-46f5-bb07-2e24e7604d1f.6ffea67f-9604-4dca-8699-35eafba95283","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#404040","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"129","PackageFamilyNames":["7121BryceHutchings.UniversalZip_n8amc39vh1w3e"],"ContentIds":["ba5462be-bdc3-cf66-3fbc-a4430e11d0c2","dbfec162-61df-6c9b-b6f1-414dc15cdc47"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Extract or create all of the most common formats including zip, 7z, rar, gzip, bzip2, tar, and wim.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show that Universal Zip is 2-3x faster than the other popular unzipping programs in the Microsoft Store.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH0FG51","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Grim Legends 2: Song Of The Dark Swan","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55000.13510798882993888.09cb1b36-51d8-4030-8aa4-bf644223ff6a.fce28782-29f7-4c38-9292-8f1ddbbe9fe3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"203","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.GrimLegends2SongoftheDarkSwan_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["d4fb2c8c-3abd-86ff-ca77-5cd310155b29"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nEmbark on a dangerous quest through mysterious ruins and magical woods in the second chapter of Grim Legends series.

They might be from when you imported photos from your camera twice, or downloaded the same movie to two different locations. Maybe you have a long-forgotten backup lurking somewhere on your system, or maybe you have duplicate albums from merging two music libraries together.\r\n\r\nFinding these stealthy space hogs is tedious. Disko Duplicate Cleaner does it for you – it's fast, safe, and automatic. Reclaim precious storage space in just two taps. It uses a proprietary scanning engine to search your device for duplicate files. \r\n\r\nIt's smart – the accurate scanner shows you a list of every detected duplicate file in just seconds. And to help you browse the results any matched images are previewed right inside the app, while matched music and videos indicate song duration and bitrate.\r\n\r\nIt's FAST – it scans thousands of files per minute with no false matches.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to use – its intuitive previewer automatically shows you the contents of suspected duplicates. And it's safe – it removes duplicates to the Recycle Bin for easy undoing, and by default it won't touch system files.\r\n\r\nDisko Duplicate Cleaner is made exclusively for the Windows Store. It's brought to you by the same team behind the popular Disko File Scanner, the five-star rated disk utility featured across the web.

Add custom (extended PIDs) and get information, that was hidden from you by car manufacturer!\r\nIt can also show and reset a DTC fault code like a scantool. Now with Mode 06 - ECU self-monitoring test results. Helps you fix your car and helps keep repair costs down!\r\nWorks on any vehicle that uses the OBD 2 standard (most vehicles built after 2000, but can work for vehicles as far back as 1996).\r\nCar Scanner supports all OBD2-compatible vehicles and provides exclusive extra features for some cars of:\r\nOpel/Vauxhal/Chevrolet, Hyundai/Kia, Renault, Nissan, Infinity, Mitsubishi, Toyota, VAZ, UAZ\r\n\r\nThe app needs a Bluetooth OBD2 ELM327 compatible adapter to work. The adapter is small and plugs into the diagnostics socket on the car which gives your phone access.\r\nIf you buy one of the cheap china OBD2 ELM327 bluetooth adapters from ebay / amazon, then make sure it’s not marked as v.2.1. This adapters are supported, but they have lot’s of bugs.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Vehicle ECUs vary in the amount of sensors supported. This app can’t show you something, that is not provided by your car.\r\nAND ONE MORE THING: This app is Beta version. It means that it is in development state.\r\nAttention \"bad\" adapters! We faced the problem, that some adapters (often Chinese one and marked as v.2.1), can’t connect to the smartphone or the car. Some of them can even make your car engine work unstable, often lost connection, increase time lag when reading data.\r\nSo, we recommend you to use ELM327 ver. 1.4-1.5 and AVOID USING cheap ELM327

you disappointed with the color reproduction of your monitor?\r\n\r\nDo you wish to color calibrate it but can't justify shelling out hundreds on a colorimeter?\r\n\r\nThen if you already own an

\r\n\r\nColor measurement data is transmitted from the camera phone via Bluetooth.  Display Calibration analyzes the measurements and produce the desired color calibration data for your monitor, embedded in an International Color Consortium (ICC) compatible profile.\r\n\r\nThe ICC profile can then be installed on your PC to complete the calibration process (this step is performed manually as Windows currently does not allow calibration profiles to be directly installed from a Store app).\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- Bluetooth\r\n\r\n- An external Android device with a back-facing camera and supporting Android's manual white balance and exposure Camera2 APIs, and running a free \"Camera Colorimeter\" app by Auralisoft.  \r\n\r\nPlease note:  iOS/iPhone and Windows Phone devices are ***NOT*** supported.\r\n\r\n- Access to a reference D65 white point would be useful but if one isn't available, natural sunlight may be a good enough substitute. \r\n\r\n***NOTE***\r\nCalibration of monitors connected to USB display adapters (including USB port replicators/docking stations such as Dell D3100) is not supported.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VP2H","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Neutron Music Player","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54367.13510798887506504.89a773d0-75fc-4848-87f8-55b4835cbaf2.abaec564-66d7-44df-99b2-4400485ba387","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61306.13510798887506504.50c5ecc8-d5ae-4138-85b5-15446c24d815.7d57edc1-686c-4d75-b5a1-7d6dce6d2448","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£5.89","Price":5.89,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["NeutronCodeLimited.NeutronMusicPlayer_63vf3jxagy284"],"ContentIds":["420752f8-35e2-36fa-5fc6-699b275dd8c3","378189b4-c614-2f49-83e1-f0fed8008bfe"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Neutron is an advanced music player with close-to-metal 32/64-bit audio engine which delivers the best possible Hi-Fi grade quality of sound on your Windows device.\r\n\r\nNeutron offers high-resolution audio playback without frequency resampling and bits truncation if internal/external DAC supports it via Exclusive mode.\r\n\r\nThanks to input/output network capabilities Neutron is the only application in the market capable of sending audio to the network renderers (UPnP/DLNA, Chromecast) with all DSP effects applied including true gapless playback.\r\n\r\nIt features the sophisticated UI with advanced options and controls for music playback.

at any time you run into an issue, first send us an email to admin@hasfocus.com, to help you get past the issue!\r\n\r\nDictation App is an advanced speech-to-text tool designed to help you compose longer pieces of content, such as articles or essays, without the keyboard or while walking and holding your smartphone.\r\n\r\nNot only are its dictation capabilities exceedingly accurate, editing content is convenient and a pleasure. Just select the length of text that you want to replace, say whatever you want to replace it with, and it's done! \r\n\r\nIn addition to most of vocabulary, Dictation App recognizes several commands that give you more control. Those are: New paragraph, new line, comma, exclamation mark, question mark and semi-colon. It also understands the text emoticons of Smiley, Frownie and Winkie. And this is just the Dictate & Edit screen.\r\n\r\nDictation App is also a handy text-to-speech tool. Any text that you generate or enter into the app, it can narrate back to you in the voice of whichever Cortana language you happen to be using. Each Cortana language comes with a female and male voice personality that sound more natural than synthetic. You can also vary the rate of the narration.\r\n\r\nThe Output screen of Dictation App lets you export the content that you have generated. There are several options. You can save it as a Text File, send it as Email with a file attachment to one or more contacts, send it as SMS with a file attachment to one or more contacts, or Share it with other apps that accept text content. You can also print the first page or save it as a PDF file.\r\n\r\nContent can also be saved as an RTF file that supports formatting and can be opened by Microsoft Word. The RTF editor is equipped with several buttons including Bold, Italic, Underline, Font-size, Font color, Highlight, Hyperlink, Left, Right and Center alignment.\r\n\r\nDictation App converts your spoken words into text in real time, with high accuracy and efficiency. You can correct any misunderstandings easily by selecting and repeating. Generating 500 word articles, 1000 word articles and even essays is an easier process because Writer's Block and analysis paralysis are no longer an issue.\r\n\r\nThis dictation software for Windows 10 has a free 24-hour trial period and then a price of $2.49. Try it out and see how many cool features it really packs. HasFocus.com listens to customer feedback so if a feature is missing, send us an email and let us know.

Even color the same picture more than once, to see what else you can do with it.  No need to worry about losing your coloring pencils in the couch anymore!\r\n\r\nThe app comes with one free coloring book, and other books are available as small in-app purchases.  Books are created by indie artists, so all of them have a unique feel and style.  New books are being added all the time, so keep checking back in the in-app store to see what's been published lately.  Half of the proceeds from every in app purchase goes directly to the artist, so keep 'em drawing if you like their stuff!\r\n\r\nColorist also works with a mouse, pen and touch.  Coloring with your finger is fine, but a pressure sensitive stylus is what Colorist was designed for and where it truly shines.  The app is fully functional in the free version - the only purchases are any extra coloring books you choose to buy.\r\n\r\nIf you're an artist and want to submit a book for colorist, reach out at submissions@factionapps.com.  We're always looking for awesome new pages!\r\n\r\nSome of the cool stuff:\r\n- No need to lug around a coloring book and manage a bunch of pencils - its all there on your tablet!\r\n- Blend, shade, and even erase (something your coloring pencils won't do!)\r\n- Automatically stay inside the lines - for when you're feeling impatient!\r\n- Support an indie artist and feel good!  Half of the in app purchase proceeds go straight to the artist.  \r\n- Keep as many colored pages on the go as you want, they'll all be right where you left them.\r\n- Create your own masterpiece sketches, when you're feeling especially creative!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MWDGFT3M7V2","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Playlist Downloader for YouTube MP3 & MP4","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36571.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.4cb3eae6-4d46-45f0-8699-8759b119ad99","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49728.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.61c499a1-a9c0-41a6-984b-116f381313e5","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53811.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.6f070a1d-5301-4b83-a70b-c880218b701a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8526.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.ecc2da35-d467-4332-a018-c09f9f3a2fd7","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55683.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.8d533031-cb66-456c-9469-d432d409866d","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6442.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.63761dec-b837-4725-b361-8ac4bd74410f","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56184.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.b669362d-998b-4618-9e69-ed7bd5af05a2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59130.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.e1fc1c53-308d-4fc4-aca6-a1e3c70414ee","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35297.13841019298749829.b0e7c4ae-2c39-45e4-ab97-8530093b58d4.aa0b2875-00e5-4f46-9d41-661ac633006e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32892QuadrApp.PlaylistDownloaderforYouTubeMP3MP4_3c625vswm98wp"],"ContentIds":["c3f9df27-4587-b5ba-5814-2c74069c6ef0","60a0435b-e01e-740d-3601-370485e5a459"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Downloading music online may be around the lips of numerous music enthusiasts nowadays but to the uninitiated, it may be pretty confusing and sometimes difficult for the individual.
